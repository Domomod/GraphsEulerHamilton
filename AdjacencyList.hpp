/*
Adjacency List is a Graph Representation, read more at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list
#Variables:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lists (STL list of int): 
    pointer to table of adjacency list, one for every node in the graph
size (int):
    number of nodes
visited (int*):
    pointer to a table for DFS traversal, declared as a member variable, because DFS 
    itself is implemented recursively and need this table in every lever of recursion,
        this table contains a map of visited nodes
predecessors (int*):
    pointer to a table for BFS traversal, declared as a member variable,
        each position of the table contains a number of predecessors so far not visited 
sorted (int*):
    pointer to a table containing a traversal (BFS or DFS)
type (int):
    type of adjacecny matrix, base on the enumerator:
        NEXT - list of succesors
        PREV - list of predecesors
        NOINCIDENCY - list of nodes with which there is no connection to current node
#Methods:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
constructor:
    create a graph from a linear sequence of nodes.
destructor:
    frees memory
bool connected(int, int):
    check if edge exists

void print_list(void):
    print all stored Adjacency lists

list<int>::iterator firstOnTheList(int n)
    return begining of n'th list 

list<int>::iterator lastOnTheList(int n)
    return end of n'th list 

list<int>::iterator nextOnTheList(int n):
    return next on the n'th list, after iterating through whole
    list, loop to the begining

void Hamilton(int, bool):
    int is starting point
    find Hamilton cycle if bool == true
    find all Hamilton cycles if bool == false

void Euler(int):
    int is starting point, 
    find an Euler cycle
